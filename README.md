<h1 align="center"> Hello and Welcome! </h1>

 I'm Cristiane Koshino and I started to study development in March/2020, since then I keep studying and learning with focus in Frontend development.
 
 I'm from Brazil and always worked for IT department, mostly as a process analyst, working with customer services, Itil, areas with focus in IT service management. In 2017 I decided to move to Portugal and in 2018 I thought: <em><strong>"Changed country...why not change my career?".</strong></em>
